Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.<br>

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. <br>
For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].<br><br>

 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]<br>
Output: 4<br>
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.<br><br>

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]<br>
Output: 4<br><br>

Example 3:

Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]<br>
Output: 1<br><br>
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2500
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
 

## Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(n log(n)) time complexity? ðŸ˜‹
